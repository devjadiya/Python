# Multi words variable names

# Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
# There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:



# Camel Case 
# Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
myVariable = "rey"




# Pascal Case
# Each word starts with a capital letter:
MyVariableName = "rey"



# Snake Case
# Each word is separated by an underscore character: 
my_variable_name = "rey"
